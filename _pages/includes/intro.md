I work at [the School of Computer Science](http://cs.njupt.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/logo-njuptcs.png' style='width: 6em;'> as an assistant professor  now, doing some fundamental research on reinforcement learning and multi-agent learning and also recruiting graduate students. If interested, feel free to email me at [sdyang@njupt.edu.cn](mailto:sdyang@njupt.edu.cn).

I graduated from [the School of Informantion Science and Technology](https://sist.swjtu.edu.cn/home?lang=cn), Southwest Jiaotong University (西南交通大学信息学院) with a bachelor's degree in 2013 and from [the Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University (南京大学计算机系) with a Ph.D's degree in 2020, advised by professor [Yang Gao (高阳)](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/gaoyang/index.htm).

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published more than 30 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
